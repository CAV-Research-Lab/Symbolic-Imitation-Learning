# Symbolic-Imitation-Learning-using-Inductive-Logic-Programming
We extract symbolic first-order logical rules using inductive logic programming (ILP) to find a safe and legal policy in autonomous highway driving. Using inductive reasoning, this method is interpretable, generalizable, and data-efficient.
